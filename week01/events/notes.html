            Slowly figuring out how to get things done using github. This page, as well as the folder it's in, was created using Sublime Text and Sublime Merge to get it into my WDD330 repository on GitHub. However, I keep getting messages from Sublime that it is a trial period and I need to get a license. I will check to see if BYUI Bookstore offers this to students. Otherwise, I don't want to invest time learning Sublime integration when I may not be using it the whole semester. This new material is already confusing enough.

          			<strong>Speed matters!</strong> Reduce images on webpage designs unless necessary. If an image is needed, choose to use a <STRONG>SVG/Webfonts</STRONG> image. They are much smaller filesizes and consume much less bandwidth; they are scalable on any screen size so their quality won't be affected.
          		</li>
          		<li>
          			Before loading webpage for consumption, <strong>MINIFY</strong>. This will remove white space from your CSS and JS code. (Research MINIFY)
          		</li>
          		<li>
          			<strong>GZIP</strong> files to further compress the JS and CSS code so that the webpage loads faster.(Research GZIP)
          		</li>
          		<li>FLOAT LABELS???? First time seeing these. How do you make/incorporate them?</li>
          		<li>
          			SHOW PASSWORDS - make this default in your signin designs. Have HIDE option available for users who wish to conceal their password entries. Showing passwords as users type in is tested to be faster and prevent users from doing other steps like retrieving forgotten passwords or resetting passwords that have been forgotten.

          		<li>
          			MAKE ALL PHONE NUMBERS TAPPABLE/CLICKABLE: Ex - <xmp><a href="tel:12223334444">1-222-333-4444</a></xmp>
