            Slowly figuring out how to get things done using github. This page, as well as the folder it's in, was created using Sublime Text and Sublime Merge to get it into my WDD330 repository on GitHub. However, I keep getting messages from Sublime that it is a trial period and I need to get a license. I will check to see if BYUI Bookstore offers this to students. Otherwise, I don't want to invest time learning Sublime integration when I may not be using it the whole semester. This new material is already confusing enough.
