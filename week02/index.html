        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Is the 5MB storage limit for local storage for each website or for the browser in general ?
          </li>
          <li>
            What happens when the 5MB of local storage is met?<br>
            Is there a browser algorithm which frees up space when needed?
          </li>
          <li>
            When/what data gets saved to the local storage most commonly? Saved login info? User bio data(name,address,etc.)?
          </li>
          <li>
            Does clearing browser history also clear out local storage? Would clearing local storage regularly improve browser loading or performance?
          </li>
          <li>
            Primitve datatype Symbol: Two variables are able to share the same symbol by using "for".<br>
            <em>Example:</em><pre>const A = Symbol.for('shared symbol'); <br>const B = Symbol.for('shared symbol');</pre>
            Yet the textbook states "The uniqueness of symbols, mean that itâ€™s impossible for the names of any properties to clash with each other if they are symbols."(JSNinja2 p.54)<br>
            How can properties in a class retain uniqueness if they are able to be assigned the same symbol name?
          </li>
          <li>
            In my previous classes that dealt with JavaScript (CS124, CS213) many of the basic topics mentioned in JSNinja2 were not covered, such as the primitive data type Symbol and the alternate way of performing a SWAP of two variable using deconstructured arrays. Every neat tidbit I have read about in JSNinja2 which wasn't taught to me in the previous BYUI online courses seems to be from the ES6 JavaScript release. Is the material for the previous courses older than ES6 (released in 2015 I think)?
