        <a href="main.html">Lesson Examples</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Forms</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The <b>autofocus attribute</b> give focus to this element when a page loads. It is the
equivalent to putting the following line of JavaScript in main.js:<pre> document.forms.hero.heroName.focus();</pre> Instead, use autofocus like so:<pre>&lt;input type='text' id='heroName' name='heroName' <b>autofocus</b> placeholder='Your Super Hero Name' maxlength=32&gt;</pre> </li>
            <li>
              <b>Types of INPUT:</b>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>Text:</b> This is the default input type.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Password:</b> This works in the same way as an input field with type='text', except the characters are concealed as they are entered so they’re unable to be read on the screen.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Checkbox:</b> Check boxes are created using input fields with type='checkbox'. They are used to select different options that can be checked (true) or left unchecked (false). The user can select more than one checkbox from a list.<br><br>
                  Make all the checkbox elements have the same 'name' property of 'powers'. This means they can be accessed as an <b>HTML collection</b>, like so:  <code>form.powers;</code>.<br>
                  The state of the checkbox can be set with HTML:<pre>&lt;input type='checkbox' value='Flight' name='powers' <b>checked</b>&gt;</pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Radio:</b> Like checkboxes they allow users to check an option as true, but they provide an exclusive choice of options, <b>so only one option can be selected.</b> Give radio buttons the <b>same name attribute</b>. This is used to group them together ― <b>only one radio button can be checked in a group that has the same name attribute.</b> It also means we can access an HTML collection of all the radio buttons in that group using the property of the same name ― as can be seen in this line of code:<pre>form.category;</pre>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

            <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                3 main OOP concepts: <b>Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism.</b>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Encapsulation:</b> Involves keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement the functionality, without the outside world needing to know how it’s done.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Inheritance:</b> Various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Polymorphism:</b> Means we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Prototype-based language:</b> A language, like JavaScript, that uses actual objects as the blueprint for creating more objects.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>OBJECTS:</b> Week 3 discussed JavaScript objects. They can be created as <em>literals</em>. <br><b>An object literal is an object that is created directly in the language by wrapping all its properties and methods in curly braces {}. </b><br>Object literals are a distinguishing feature of the JavaScript language, as they allow objects to be created quickly without the need for defining a class. Example: <pre>const superman = {
name: 'Superman',
'real name': 'Clark Kent',
height: 75,
weight: 235,
hero: true,
villain: false,
allies: ['Batman','Supergirl','Superboy'], fly() {
return 'Up, up and away!'; }
};</pre> Create an empty object literal <b><span style="color:lime;">RECOMMENDED METHOD</span></b>: <pre>const spiderman = {};</pre> Create an empty object literal using a constructor function <b>NOT RECOMMENDED</b>: <pre>const spiderman = new Object();</pre>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Class Declaration Syntax Example:</b> <pre>class Dice { constructor(sides=6) { this.sides = sides;
}
roll() {
return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1) }
}</pre>
              </li>
              <li>
                <B>STATIC KEYWORD:</B> Adding <em>static</em> before a class method name (ex. <code>static</code> description(){return 'This is an example of a static method.'}) makes it only available to the class directly, not instances of the class. So a dice class could call Dice.description but not an instance of Dice class, like blueDice.Description - <b>[ERROR!]</b> 
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>PROTOTYPES:</b> Watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01jVgCK-HX4" target="_blank">video</a>  to see a good explanation of Prototypes.
                <h4>Point to remember:</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    In Javascript, <b>every function has a prototype object built-into it</b>. For example, a class' Constructor is a function. It thus has a Prototype object associated with it (it can be accessed with the dunder-proto [meaning <em>double underscore</em>]) <b>__proto__</b>.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
