            <B>THE READING THIS WEEK WAS <SPAN style="font-size: 2rem;">76 pages!!!!!</SPAN> C'mon!</B>
          </li>
          <li>
            I read a LOT of references to <code>-webkit- </code>prefixes in the weekly readings. <b>How serious of a design issue are older browsers and search engines?</b> For example, I regularly update all of my software. Luckily, most of the software I use automatically informs me of new updates, so I'm never far behind the times when it comes to my browser, operating systems, iOS, etc. I assume most users are the same way. So, if most users are also receiving and accepting automatic updates to their OS and browsers, should we waste much time designing webpages for outdated systems?
            <p>
               My Chrome is version 83.0 but if a user has version 39 or earlier, then I'll have to add <code>-webkit- </code>prefixes for my web designs to work on their junk. My Firefox is 76.0.1 but if a user has Firefox 16 or earlier, then my web designs won't work properly on their machine. My iOS is 13.5.1 but if a user has iOS8 or earlier then I have to design for that. <b>This seems backwards. If a user is using such old software then shouldn't the onus be on the user to modernize their junk rather than the user to design for the ancient past??? Why should a web designer today ever concern themselves with <code>-webkit</code> prefixes? What percentage of tech users are using extremely outdated software and does that percentage constitute a significant portion of the user base?</b>
